    <p>
      This project is an attempt to replicate the familiar experience of social
      networking using the Solid framework. Solid is led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee
      and his merry band of researchers. It is an abbreviated portmanteau of
      'Social' and 'Linked Data,' the semantic web concept that enables web apps
      to assemble a social graph from structured data decentralized across the
      world wide web.
